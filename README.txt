Our testing environment requires using the kaggle notebook, because of data loading limitations in google colab.


Steps to run the testing environment:


1. Load our notebook through the link: https://www.kaggle.com/rahulsehgal27/dl-project. 
Click on the copy and edit option.


2. The dataset and files containing indices for split indices and both the models are automatically loaded. The following are the datasets that would show up on the right menu under datasets (the option to expand this menu would be on the bottom right). 


Dataset Name        Filename
Stanford Dogs
indices                indices_fine-grain
resnet50-final  resnet50_final
mobilenet       mobileNet32_final


3. Before running the file, verify your kaggle account if not done already and connect to gpu. (Click on the option button with three dots on top right corner and then select the acclerator).


4. We have text box named "virtual environment for testing". You can run the cells below that text box to begin the testing.
